Password strength tester: This project would use machine learning to assess the strength of passwords. It could be used to help users create more secure passwords, or to identify weak passwords that are at risk of being hacked.
Vulnerability scanner: This project would use APIs to scan websites and web applications for vulnerabilities. It could be used by businesses to identify and fix security holes in their websites, or by security researchers to find new vulnerabilities.
Phishing simulator: This project would create realistic phishing emails that could be used to test the security awareness of employees. It could be used by businesses to train their employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.
Malware analysis tool: This project would use machine learning to analyze malware samples. It could be used by security researchers to identify new malware threats, or by businesses to investigate malware infections.
Honeypot: This project would create a fake system that is designed to attract and trap hackers. It could be used by businesses to collect data on hackers' techniques and tools, or by security researchers to study the behavior of hackers.
